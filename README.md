# E-Commerce MERN Children Clothing Resell Site

Welcome to Kids' Closet, my E-Commerce platform focused on reselling children's gently used clothing, shoes and accessories, built with the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. This full-stack application utilizes technologies such as JWT for authentication, AJAX for asynchronous requests, and follows CRUD operations for seamless user interaction.

## Technologies Used
- MongoDB: NoSQL database for efficient data storage.
- Express.js: Web application framework for Node.js.
- React: Frontend library for building user interfaces.
- Node.js: JavaScript runtime for server-side development.
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens): Used for secure user authentication.
- AJAX: Asynchronous JavaScript and XML for seamless data retrieval.
- Trello Board: Project management tool to track tasks and progress.
- ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram): Visual representation of the database structure.
- Wireframe: Blueprint for the site's layout and design.
- Render: Hosting platform for deploying the application.

## Getting Started
To get started, check out our [Trello Board](https://trello.com/invite/b/ZFxIH9OY/ATTIbf31afe8ee047618fe93acb8d609c8ebE2984F7A/kids-closet) for an overview of tasks and progress. The deployed application can be accessed [Render](https://kidss-closet.onrender.com/).

## Unsolved Problems
- Incorporating real-time notifications for user interactions.
- Optimizing performance for a larger number of concurrent users.
- Adding functionality to able to remove products from the cart without having to go back to "Shop" to remove. 

## Future Enhancements
This project serves as a foundation for a more sophisticated platform. Future enhancements may include:
- Integration of a payment gateway for seamless transactions.
- Integration of a shipping gateway for seamless delivery.
- Enhanced recommendation engine based on user preferences.
- Implementing a user feedback system for seller and buyer reviews.
- Adding carousel effect for featured products.
- Creating a seperate API to update product content.
- Better more asthetic visuals.
